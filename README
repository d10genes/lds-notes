These are notes based on Stanford EE263, written up in Emac's Orgmode, outputted to LaTeX and html.

See
https://github.com/d10genes/emacs-starter-kit/blob/master/starter-kit-latex.org
and especially 'My LaTeX stuff' in
https://github.com/d10genes/emacs-starter-kit/blob/master/starter-kit-org.org
for implementation details.

LaTeX matrices were converted from Orgmode tables with `matrixify' function from
